  //     a combination of a user's identity and an access mask. An audit rule also
  //     contains information about the how the rule is inherited by child objects,
  //     how that inheritance is propagated, and for what conditions it is audited.

    // Parameters:
    //   identity:
    //     The identity to which the audit rule applies. This parameter must be an object
    //     that can be cast as a System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier.

    //     The cryptographic key operation for which this audit rule generates audits.
