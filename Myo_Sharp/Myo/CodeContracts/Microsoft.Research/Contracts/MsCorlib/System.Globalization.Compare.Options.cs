    // Summary:
    //     Indicates that the string comparison must ignore nonspacing combining characters,
    //     such as diacritics. The Unicode Standard defines combining characters as
    //     characters that are combined with base characters to produce a new character.
    //     Nonspacing combining characters do not occupy a spacing position by themselves
    //     when rendered. For more information on nonspacing combining characters, see
    //     The Unicode Standard at the Unicode home pagehttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=37123.

    //     symbols, the ampersand, and so on.

    // Summary:
    //     Indicates that the string comparison must ignore the Kana type. Kana type
    //     refers to Japanese hiragana and katakana characters, which represent phonetic
    //     sounds in the Japanese language. Hiragana is used for native Japanese expressions
    //     and words, while katakana is used for words borrowed from other languages,
    //     such as "computer" or "Internet". A phonetic sound can be expressed in both
    //     hiragana and katakana. If this value is selected, the hiragana character
    //     for one sound is considered equal to the katakana character for the same
    //     sound.
    IgnoreKanaType = 8,
    //
    // Summary:
    //     Indicates that the string comparison must ignore the character width. For
    //     example, Japanese katakana characters can be written as full-width or half-width.
    //     If this value is selected, the katakana characters written as full-width
    //     are considered equal to the same characters written as half-width.
    IgnoreWidth = 16,
    //
    // Summary:
    //     String comparison must ignore case, then perform an ordinal comparison. This
    //     technique is equivalent to converting the string to uppercase using the invariant
    //     culture and then performing an ordinal comparison on the result.
    OrdinalIgnoreCase = 268435456,
    //
    // Summary:
    //     Indicates that the string comparison must use the string sort algorithm.
    //     In a string sort, the hyphen and the apostrophe, as well as other nonalphanumeric
    //     symbols, come before alphanumeric characters.
    StringSort = 536870912,
    //
    // Summary:
    //     Indicates that the string comparison must use the Unicode values of each
    //     character, leading to a fast comparison but one that is culture-insensitive.
    //     A string starting with "U+xxxx" comes before a string starting with "U+yyyy",
    //     if xxxx is less than yyyy. This value cannot be combined with other System.Globalization.CompareOptions
    //     values and must be used alone.
