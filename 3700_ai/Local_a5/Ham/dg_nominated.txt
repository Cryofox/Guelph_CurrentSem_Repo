You’re receiving this email because you’ve worked with Dan in some capacity in the past year.

Dan was recently nominated by the SoCS faculty for a teaching award and we’re putting together a letter of support from the student body. I am proud to say that Dan’s been my professor several times and has always been incredibly helpful to the SoCS department as a whole.

If you’d like to help us solidify Dan’s chance of winning this award, we’d love for you to send us a short message of recommendation (< 100 words) by Friday March 13th.

Thanks for your support,
