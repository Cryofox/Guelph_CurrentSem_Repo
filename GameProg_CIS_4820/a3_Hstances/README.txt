A3. Oh Boy Networks!

 With the Addition of Network Server/Client code everything got 10x messier.
Functionality is split with methods inside netServer==1, and netClient==1 for
server and client information respectively.


Code Allows multiple clients! Yes more than 1!




Map:
 The Player (You) on any client is Colored BLUE. Other clients which are also
present are coloured a Light Green, shots are coloured Pink. And the Terrain
is a mossy dark green.

Depending on Client:
	You - Blue
	Friends - Light Green
	Projectiles - Pink
