Also if I may ask another question. For the Enemys, do you want these guys to also synchronize over the network, or are they for offline mode only?

So the spec doesn't say anything against jumping as we're falling so long as we ensure you aren't able to jump more than once every 5 seconds. Does this mean the player is free to jump while falling for example when the game first loads, or should we be coding to prevent mid-air jumps ?

If it isn’t specified then it is your choice. The Important thing is to make sure that the requirements which
are specified are implemented correctly.
