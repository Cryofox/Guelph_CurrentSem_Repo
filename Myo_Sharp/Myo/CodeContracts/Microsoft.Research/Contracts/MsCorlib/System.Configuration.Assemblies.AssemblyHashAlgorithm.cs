    //     1991. It is basically MD4 with safety-belts and while it is slightly slower
    //     than MD4, it helps provide more security. The algorithm consists of four
    //     distinct rounds, which has a slightly different design from that of MD4.
    //     Message-digest size, as well as padding requirements, remain the same.
