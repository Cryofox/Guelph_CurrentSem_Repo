Sample APIscan arguments file.

The following attributes are required: 

* softwareName    - name of the software
    * softwareVersion - version of the software
    * softwareBuild   - build of the software
    * softwareFolder  - root folder of the software
    * outputFolder    - output folder for APIscan

For release runs the following attribute is required: 
    * confirm - by setting this argument to "true" you are confirming that you have
                verified that ALL the files, including SETUP files, for your 
                software are included in the analysis.

The following attributes are optional (defaults in parenthesis):     
    * mode                 - "pre-release" or "release" ("pre-release")
    * exclusionList        - exclusion list (no list). Valid only in pre-release mode.
    * email				   - email alias of a contact for this run (current user)
    * symbolsFolder        - symbols folder (srv*\\symbols\symbols). Valid only in pre-release mode.
    * preBbtBinariesFolder - root folder of the unoptimized binaries (no unoptimized binaries)
    * preBbtSymbolsFolder  - root folder of the unoptimized symbols (<preBbt>\symbols if the directory exists)
    
    * noCopySymbols        - "true" or "false" ("false"). If true, symbols will not be copied to a local temporary 
                             directory.  Primary use: if you already have all your symbols locally you can just 
                             point at that directory and avoid the time this copy takes. Valid only in pre-release mode.
    * noCopyBinaries       - "true" or "false" ("false"). If true, software folder files will not be copied to a 
                             local temporary directory.  Do this only if you already have a *destructable* local 
                             copy of the app.  (the explosion will be in-place, so the files in this directory 
                             will be modified by this operation). Valid only in pre-release mode.
    * noDecompress         - "true" or "false" ("false"). If true, no decompression of files will occur. This is you 
                             certifying to ApiScan that you already decompressed the app (or are giving us 
                             pre-compressed files). Valid only in pre-release mode.
    * isLargeApp           - "true" or "false" ("false"). If true, MaX API will compute a smaller call graph, which will
                             consume less memory. However, source location information will not be available. This 
                             should be set to "true", only when the analyzer runs out of memory while calling the 
                             MaX API, with the "false" setting. This will be visible in the backtrace in the details log.
                             The backtrace will have calls to methods starting with PPRC.Max...
    * analyzerTimeout      - Timeout for analysis phase (e.g. "2:30:00" for 2 hours 30 minutes)
