    // Summary:
    //     The query may return multiple result sets. Execution of the query may affect
    //     the database state. Default sets no System.Data.CommandBehavior flags, so
    //     calling ExecuteReader(CommandBehavior.Default) is functionally equivalent

    // Summary:
    //     The query returns column information only. When using System.Data.CommandBehavior.SchemaOnly,
    //     the .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server precedes the statement being
    //     executed with SET FMTONLY ON.

    // Summary:
    //     The query is expected to return a single row. Execution of the query may
    //     affect the database state. Some .NET Framework data providers may, but are
    //     not required to, use this information to optimize the performance of the
    //     command. When you specify System.Data.CommandBehavior.SingleRow with the
    //     System.Data.OleDb.OleDbCommand.ExecuteReader() method of the System.Data.OleDb.OleDbCommand
    //     object, the .NET Framework Data Provider for OLE DB performs binding using
    //     the OLE DB IRow interface if it is available. Otherwise, it uses the IRowset
    //     interface. If your SQL statement is expected to return only a single row,
    //     specifying System.Data.CommandBehavior.SingleRow can also improve application
    //     performance. It is possible to specify SingleRow when executing queries that
    //     return multiple result sets. In that case, multiple result sets are still
    //     returned, but each result set has a single row.
    SingleRow = 8,
    //
    // Summary:
    //     Provides a way for the DataReader to handle rows that contain columns with
    //     large binary values. Rather than loading the entire row, SequentialAccess
    //     enables the DataReader to load data as a stream. You can then use the GetBytes
    //     or GetChars method to specify a byte location to start the read operation,
    //     and a limited buffer size for the data being returned.
    SequentialAccess = 16,
    //
    // Summary:
    //     When the command is executed, the associated Connection object is closed
    //     when the associated DataReader object is closed.
