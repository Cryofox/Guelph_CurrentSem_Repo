A sincere thank you to everyone who’s already sent us their support for this nomination.

If you haven’t had a chance to write anything yet, this is a reminder that you have until the end of today to send us a message to include in our letter of support for Dan. After that, we’ll be sending in our letter to the decision making committee. 

If you’re strapped for time, send us something tweet sized and simple!

Thank you all so much,
