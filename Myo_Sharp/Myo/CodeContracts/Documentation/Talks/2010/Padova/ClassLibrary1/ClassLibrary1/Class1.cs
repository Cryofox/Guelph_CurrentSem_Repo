// Investigation for bug 845105
// Customer wants a postcondition saying Guid.NewGuid() != Guid.Empty.
//   -->  Raymond Chen says CoCreateGuid should never return Guid.Empty or it 
//        would violate its attempt at a uniqueness guarantee.
// Customer wants the static checker to understand String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace
//        This test passes the static checker when it should theoretically fail.  
//        Manuel says the static checker doesn't look at the content of a String,
//        only the length & non-nullness.
// Customer has a predicate involving booleans that doesn't work with the byte
//   value 0 for some reason, unless we carefully write the check to deal with 0 explicitly.
