Hi Everyone,

I’m starting to write you quick emails at important parts of the
semester to help you stay on track.

Today is the last day to drop one semester courses, and the last day to
apply to gradate at Summer 2015 Convocation. Take a minute to double
check your courses on WebAdvisor.

Course selection for summer and fall courses is open, or will be soon,
depending on your window. If you’re having trouble getting into a CIS
course let me know so I can help.

Hope to see many of you at the Tech Showcase next Wednesday evening.

Sincerely,
Greg

P.S. Feel free to ask me more questions! I’m happy to double check your
academic plans or help you find resources.
