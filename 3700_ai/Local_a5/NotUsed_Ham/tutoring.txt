Hi,

I've been contacted by a student who is registered with  SAS (formerly CSD).  This student is looking for a tutor for CIS*2750 and is having no luck on the tutoring@guelph site.  I told the student that I would try to help her (in my role as associate director).

If you are interested in tutoring for cis*2750 please let me know and I will pass your name on to the student.

Thanks!
