           Special Announcement  

Annual General Meeting with FREE PIZZA
 

 
Hi CPES Students,
 
The time has come to elect your CPESSC Executive for the 2015/2016 school year! As you might have heard, our Annual General Meeting is taking place next Tuesday, March 24 at 5:30pm in MacN 113. At the AGM, there will be free pizza, constitutional changes, and elections. 
 
Beginning today, the nomination period is open for executive positions. 
 The 5 positions on the CPESSC Executive are President, VP Social Affairs, VP Communications, VP Internal and VP Finance. 

 If you have any questions about what these positions entail, or what CPESSC is like,  please don't hesitate to send us an email. 

 If you are interested in running for a position, the attached nomination form must be completed by 11:59pm Friday.

 At the AGM, you will have the opportunity to give a short speech and answer questions that students may have. 

 If you are interested in running for a position, but are unable to attend the meeting, you will have the opportunity to write a short blurb about yourself and one of the exec will present on your behalf at the meeting. 

The following is a notice of motion to all CPES students that constitutional changes are being proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
In addition to regular updates and edits, we are planning to re-organize the executive structure. The change (which will be presented at the AGM) will remove the position of VP Operations, add the position of VP Communications, and will also amend the job description for VP Internal.
 
If you have any questions about the AGM, the constitutional change, or elections, please don't hesitate to email cpessc@uoguelph.ca.
 
Hope to see you next Tuesday!
 
CPESSC Exec 2014/2015
