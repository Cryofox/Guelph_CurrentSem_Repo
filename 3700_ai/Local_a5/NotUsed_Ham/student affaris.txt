Celebrations are ahead of us as St. Patrick's day arrives on Tuesday.  The Town & Gown Committee of
Guelph encourages all students to have a safe and enjoyable St. Patrick's Day, while respecting the
community in
which we all live.

As part of our collaborative initiative, the Guelph Police Service and the City of Guelph By-law Compliance
Department will have an increased presence in neighbourhoods as they partner to provide a safe community
environment for all Guelph residents.

The late night bus service will be operating during the evening of March 17th, to provide everyone with an
opportunity to get home safely at the end of the evening. Guelph Police Services will also be operating
R.I.D.E. programs throughout the City to reduce drinking and driving.

Having a party? Contact Off-Campus Living at extension 56276 or email ocl@uoguelph.ca for information
about hosting safe and responsible parties, city regulations and fines, or general neighbourhood issues. City
of Guelph resources can be found at http://guelph.ca/seasonal/students-living-campus/

We hope you have a fantastic St. Patrick's Day. Please celebrate responsibly and respectfully.

Sincerely,

Town & Gown Committee of Guelph
