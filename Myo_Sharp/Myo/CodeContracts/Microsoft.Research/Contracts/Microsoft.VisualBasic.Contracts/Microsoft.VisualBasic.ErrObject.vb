    '' Summary:
    ''     Generates a run-time error can be used instead of the Error statement.
    ''
    '' Parameters:
    ''   Number:
    ''     Required. Long integer that identifies the nature of the error. Visual Basic
    ''     errors are in the range 0–65535 the range 0–512 is reserved for system errors
    ''     the range 513–65535 is available for user-defined errors. When setting the
    ''     Number property to your own error code in a class module, you add your error
    ''     code number to the vbObjectError constant. For example, to generate the error
    ''     number 513, assign vbObjectError + 513 to the Number property.
    ''
    ''   Source:
    ''     Optional. String expression naming the object or application that generated
    ''     the error. When setting this property for an object, use the form project.class.
    ''     If Source is not specified, the process ID of the current Visual Basic project
    ''     is used.
    ''
    ''   Description:
    ''     Optional. String expression describing the error. If unspecified, the value
    ''     in the Number property is examined. If it can be mapped to a Visual Basic
    ''     run-time error code, the string that would be returned by the Error function
    ''     is used as the Description property. If there is no Visual Basic error corresponding
    ''     to the Number property, the "Application-defined or object-defined error"
    ''     message is used.
    ''
    ''   HelpFile:
    ''     Optional. The fully qualified path to the Help file in which help on this
    ''     error can be found. If unspecified, Visual Basic uses the fully qualified
    ''     drive, path, and file name of the Visual Basic Help file.
    ''
    ''   HelpContext:
    ''     Optional. The context ID identifying a topic within HelpFile that provides
    ''     help for the error. If omitted, the Visual Basic Help-file context ID for
    ''     the error corresponding to the Number property is used, if it exists.
