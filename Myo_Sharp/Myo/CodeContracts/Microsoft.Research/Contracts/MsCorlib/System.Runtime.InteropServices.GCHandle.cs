    //     When an object is collected, the contents of the System.Runtime.InteropServices.GCHandle
    //     are zeroed. Weak references are zeroed before the finalizer runs, so even
    //     if the finalizer resurrects the object, the Weak reference is still zeroed.

    // Summary:

    //     but the handle is not zeroed if the object is resurrected during finalization.
    WeakTrackResurrection = 1,
    //
    // Summary:
    //     This handle type represents an opaque handle, meaning you cannot resolve
    //     the address of the pinned object through the handle. You can use this type
    //     to track an object and prevent its collection by the garbage collector. This
    //     enumeration member is useful when an unmanaged client holds the only reference,
    //     which is undetectable from the garbage collector, to a managed object.
    Normal = 2,
    //
    // Summary:
    //     This handle type is similar to System.Runtime.InteropServices.GCHandleType.Normal,
    //     but allows the address of the pinned object to be taken. This prevents the
    //     garbage collector from moving the object and hence undermines the efficiency
    //     of the garbage collector. Use the System.Runtime.InteropServices.GCHandle.Free()
    //     method to free the allocated handle as soon as possible.
